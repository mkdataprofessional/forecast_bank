# Forecast_Bank Project

## Overview
The **Forecast_Bank** project demonstrates **exploratory data analysis** (EDA), revenue forecasting using logistic regression and KPI analysis on model banking data. This data is stored in an **SQL database**, and the corresponding file is included in the project repository.  

The primary objective of this project is to analyze key financial patterns, forecast revenue, and explore correlations within the dataset.  

## Installation & Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

3. **Install dependencies using `pip`**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Components
### **Jupyter Notebook (`forecast & patterns & kpis.ipynb`)**
This notebook contains the following key analyses:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data investigation and cleaning.
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Predicting future financial performance using statistical modeling.
- **Patterns & Correlations Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Evaluating financial metrics.
- **Individual KPI Analysis**: Detailed assessment for a selected employee.

### **Additional Materials**
- **PowerPoint Presentation (`forecast_bank_presentation.pptx`)**:
  - **Model Scorecard Report**: Performance metrics for the model employee.
  - **Future Development Suggestions**: Proposed enhancements to the project.

## Future Development
Potential improvements include:
- Enhancing predictive modeling with more sophisticated algorithms.
- Incorporating external economic indicators for better forecasting.
- Refining KPI evaluations for deeper business insights.
